## Setup
All dependencies can be found in package.json. Project currently runs with 'angular-in-memory-web-api' which can be found in app/in-memory-data.service which will always initiate the same database.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
